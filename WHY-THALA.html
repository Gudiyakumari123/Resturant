Started as a Betel nut shop, Mr. Nagasamy Naidu took the chance of opening a small 4-seater hotel 
which made him realise that his wife’s unique style of biriyani had potential to go places. Started 
by serving his locality, the biriyani brought in many fans from the neighbouring cities. A special blend
 of spices is used for the biryani. A type of short grain seeraga samba rice, called Parakkum Sittu and 
 Kannivadi meat which comes from tender grass-fed goats makes the taste distinct. This rice, unlike basmati
 has no taste of its own, so it completely absorbs the flavours of the spices.
